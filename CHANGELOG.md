# Changelog

All notable changes to Chirp are documented here.

## v1.4.6 — May 2026

### New
- Ping — a built-in feedback form right in the sidebar. Bugs and features become public GitHub issues; support and other go to private email.
- Welcome panel after every update — the first launch of a new version auto-opens with the release notes.
- Auto-update checks now run four times a day. The version chip subline shows when the last check happened — "Checked 2h ago".

### Improved
- About popover redesigned — version info now lives in its own header bar above the brand zone, so the logo and tagline read as identity again.
- Update flow is smoother across the board: confirmation messages stay long enough to read, the action button now says "Install" instead of "Restart", and cancelling mid-update no longer leaves things half-done.
- Calmer update chip — checks pulse with a quiet ellipsis instead of a loading wheel, and the success checkmark springs in with confidence.
- Update progress now sweeps continuously across download + prepare — no more reset at the handoff between phases.
- Diagnostic reports now include speed measurements, hotkey assignments, and behavior settings — fewer round-trips when something needs support.
- Menu bar dropdown — Check for Updates and Send Feedback both work directly from the menu now, no need to open Settings first.

### Fixed
- "You're on the latest version." actually shows after a manual check now — the confirmation used to disappear before it had time to register.

## v1.4.5 — May 2026

### New
- Collapse the sidebar to a slim icon rail for more room — toggle it with ⌘/.
- First launch now opens with a brief animated intro.

### Improved
- Recent activity and any in-progress work now live in one place — the Feed.
- Refreshed the title bar and in-app iconography.

### Fixed
- Recordings are now timestamped when they started, not when transcription finished — so a meeting shows the time it actually happened.
- The notch indicator no longer drifts out of place when you switch a window to full screen.

## v1.4.4 — May 2026

### New
- Reworked first-launch onboarding — clearer setup with a hands-on demo of Solo Mode.
- Press Delete to remove a transcript or speaker, anywhere in History or Speakers.
- Activity feed now logs model downloads, app updates, and onboarding completion — click any row to jump to that recording.

### Improved
- Major UI polish across every page — denser content, unified corner gutter, and the Chirp wordmark now sits in the top-right title bar.
- Update check feels deliberate now — the version pill confirms with a green checkmark that holds long enough to register before fading back.
- Search handles apostrophes correctly — typing "that's" finds the exact word instead of matching anything with the letter "s."
- Search in History is snappy again — instant response while typing.
- History stats live inside the search row and step aside when you search, filter, or select — glanceable the rest of the time.
- Cleaner bulk delete — scope toggle (Text only / Text + audio / Audio only) and Delete share one row, with an X to close.
- Recording badge tells the truth — shows "Mic only" when system audio didn't capture.
- Auto-record meetings — broader app coverage. Now detects calls in WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, RingCentral, GoTo, Chime, and more (full list in Settings tooltip).
- Speakers page populates reliably on launch — no more manual rescan.

### Fixed
- Meeting recordings are never silently deleted — empty transcripts keep the audio so you can re-transcribe later.
- Other apps' audio keeps playing during Meeting Mode.
- Queue progress shows the real count during bulk re-transcribes — no more "0 of 1" when running multiple jobs.

## v1.4.3 — May 2026

### New
- Time-remaining countdown that learns your Mac's speed.
- Smarter meeting estimates that adapt as Chirp reads the conversation.
- Time-remaining for batches — re-transcribe or recover many files at once.
- Hover any transcript's badge to see how long it took.
- Speed panel on the Models page shows your Mac's transcription speed.
- Storage page rebuilt — cleanup and orphan recovery in one place.
- Cleanup: pick what, when, and how much, with confirmation before deletion.
- Orphan files: filter, sort, preview inline, delete one or all.

### Improved
- Smoother progress bar across the app.
- In-progress queue redesigned to match the rest of the app.
- Menu bar dropdown reordered — Open Chirp is now at the top.
- Activity feed opens with day groups collapsed.

### Fixed
- Confirmation dialogs now name exactly what gets deleted and what stays.
- Speakers page shows every voice on first load — no rescan needed.

## v1.4.2 — April 2026

### Improved
- Tighter karaoke sync — the highlighted word now tracks the spoken audio accurately.
- Audio scrubber stays visible whenever a recording is expanded — drag it before pressing play.
- Dragging the scrubber pauses audio during the drag and resumes on release.
- Tighter History card row with cleaner padding around metadata.

### Fixed
- Pause now keeps your position — the next press resumes from where you stopped, not from the beginning.
- Transcript text no longer flashes during audio playback.
- Transcript text now reads correctly in dark mode.
- Numbers in transcripts now highlight correctly — the digit and the word before it were both losing their highlight.
- Tag pill is now clickable across the full pill, not just the text.
- Play / pause icon stays in the top row whether the card is collapsed or expanded.

## v1.4.1 — April 2026
